# codeignitor-distance-library-
Library to get distance between points to use in location aware webapps or APIs in codeignitor.

## Typical use case: 
To shift load from Google distance library (network calls to local library call) and to reduce page load latency in case distance needs to be shown.

 #### Ex: 
 Distance from current location to list of seach facilities (could be restaurants, gym, spa, shops etc etc...)
